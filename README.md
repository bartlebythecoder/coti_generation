# Classic Traveller Character Generator #

This JavaScript character generator for the classic Traveller sci-fi roleplaying game follows the character creation rules in The Traveller Book ([available in PDF](https://www.rpgnow.com/product/80192/CTTTBThe-Traveller-Book)).

Yes, characters _can_ die during character creation!
